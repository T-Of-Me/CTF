# 🐱 Meow Transmission: REVENGE


---

## Description

The cat is back, and he's not playing nice anymore.

Our agents intercepted another transmission (`revenge_transmission.png`). This time, the image is a colorful mess of chaotic noise. The cat claims he's "seeing in full color" now and has stopped "counting his spins."

The metadata still contains his ramblings, but something is missing. He says he has developed a "triple personality."

Can you untangle the chaos and recover the true message?

**Flag format:** `BITSCTF{...}`
